# Experiments

 - [local docker](../fuse/analysis): was the first experiment run locally (one node) to develop Markov Models
 - [local kind](local-kind): aims to extend the setup to run on a local kind cluster (across faux nodes) with automation to install the binary.
 - [slim](slim): testing if recording a container and adding those minimal assets to the same OS base saves us a lot of space (or not).
