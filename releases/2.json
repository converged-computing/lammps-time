    "body": "Changes since the 17 February 2022 patch release:\r\n- Add computes for local components of the pressure tensor in cartesian and spherical coordinates (Olav Galteland, Norwegian U of Science and Technology) PR #3165 \r\n- Major update of the LATBOLTZ package (Colin Denniston and collaborators, UWO) PR #3167 \r\n- Code optimization for several KOKKOS styles (Nicholas Curtis and Leopold Grinberd and Gina Sitaraman, AMD, Stan Moore, SNL) PR #3147, PR #3158, PR #3169 \r\n- Add fixes for damping of rotational and translational energy for extended particles (Jibril B. Coulibaly. Northwestern U) PR #3181\r\n- Add support for an inner cutoff switching function to SNAP related commands that smoothly turns of SNAP descriptors at short range (Aidan Thompson, SNL) PR #3173 \r\n- Refactor code for neighbor list requests so that no direct access to the list of requests is needed and settings are as automatic and consistent as possible (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #3159 \r\n- Refactor handling of thermodynamic output for better readability and add new thermo_style \"yaml\" (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #3179\r\n- Replace usage of non-reentrant strtok() and improve file reading and parsing using file reader and tokenizer classes (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #3180 \r\n- Memory usage optimization and bugfix for mesocnt pair style (Philipp Kloza, Cambridge U) PR #3162 \r\n- Refactor `python/install.py` script and change installation of the LAMMPS python module via `make install-python` from using distutils to setuptools. This is now a 2-step process of first creating a binary wheel (.whl) package and then installing it via pip.\r\n- Automatically load plugins in folders listed in the LAMMPS_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #3170 \r\n- Add tests for various compute (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #3163 \r\n- More content and improvements for the Programmer Guide section of the Manual (multiple authors) PR #3146 \r\n- update sphinx theme for the HTML version of the manual (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #3178 \r\n- Many small bug fixes, minor code improvements, and coding style, build system, documentation, formatting updates (multiple authors) PR #3138, PR #3139, PR #3141, PR #3142, PR #3145, PR #3148, PR #3153, PR #3155, PR #3156, PR #3161, PR #3164, PR #3166, PR #3168, PR #3171, PR #3174, PR #3177, PR #3185\r\n\r\nBackward compatibility notices:\r\n- The new version of `make install-python` will not install a package over an existing package as the old version did. Instead, it will attempt to uninstall the old package and then install the new version. Packages installed with distutils, like the old version of `make install-python`, must be manually uninstalled (they don't store a suitable manifest). This should only be needed once, since from then on uninstall should be possible.\r\n- The update to the LATBOLTZ package is a significant update that changes the syntax of the fix `lb/fluid` command in a way that is not backward compatible. Inputs must be updated accordingly. Also fixes `lb/pc` and `lb/pc/rigid/sphere` have been removed and fixes `nve` and `rigid` should be used in their stead.\r\n- The thermodynamic output is slightly changed. This may break parser implementations for analysis of LAMMPS log files that are not indifferent to whitespace changes and width of fields.  Please note the addition of thermo style \"yaml\" that should provide a mechanism that should make the process of extracting thermodynamic output data more reliable and easier to realize."

    "body": "## Important note about branch names\r\nThe LAMMPS project has changed the names of its main branches in the git repository to better represent the state of the code. The `master` branch was renamed to `develop` and the `unstable` branch became `release`. If you are following the git repository to obtain the LAMMPS source code, please update your checkouts and forks accordingly. For a limited time the `master` and `unstable` branches will be kept in sync with `develop` and `release` (through fast forwarding), but those branches will be removed eventually and then you will be **required** to use the new branch names or not have access to updates anymore.\r\n\r\n## Changes since the 29 September 2021 patch release:\r\n- New `fix acks2/reaxff` for ACKS2 charge equilibration and updates to `fix qeq/reaxff` that add support for fix efield to both charge equilibration methods. (Metin Aktulga, MSU and Stan Moore, SNL) PR #2931 \r\n- New `fix mol/swap` for swapping of atom types within a single, randomly selected molecule (Steve Plimpton, SNL) PR #2992 \r\n- Add support for multi-species potentials to ML-PACE package (Yury Lysogorskiy and the PACE library developers) PR #2968 \r\n- Preliminary support for OpenMPTarget in KOKKOS package (Rahul Gayatri, NERSC, Chris Knight, ANL, Stan Moore, SNL) PR #2997 \r\n- Implemented and applied a new namespace `platform` with abstractions of functionality that has either different behavior or uses different APIs on different platforms and operating systems.  This reduces code redundancy and enhances platform neutrality of the core LAMMPS code. (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2979 \r\n- Implemented and applied a utility function to parse boolean arguments to keywords (yes/no, on/off, true/false) (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U), PR #2951 \r\n- Semi-automatic code refactoring using clang-tidy. See issue #2946 for a discussion of individual changes. (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2990, PR #2994, PR #3002 \r\n- Many small bug fixes, minor code improvements, and coding style, build system, documentation, formatting updates (multiple authors) PR #2973, PR #2975, PR #2976, PR #2977, PR #2983, PR #2985, PR #2989, PR #2991, PR #2993, PR #2998, PR #3003, PR #3004, PR #3007 , PR #3009 \r\n\r\n## Backward compatibility notices:\r\n- Most keywords that accept \"yes/no\" or \"on/off\" parameters will now accept \"yes/no\", \"on/off\", or \"true/false\" as valid arguments. This is not (yet) reflected in the manual. Some cases where there are more than just two choices have been adapted accordingly, but not all. Backward compatibility is retained. All tests pass."

This  lifts bandwidth and access limitations and addresses some reliability issues.\r\n\r\n## General changes:\r\n* Continued refactoring of the core LAMMPS code and many packages to increase code reuse, simplify new additions, improve consistentcy, and benefit from C++11 features. Several convenience functions and classes were added in the process.\r\n* Reorganization of packages: the \"USER\" prefix has been dropped, some packages have prefixes to group them (CG-, DPD-, EXTRA-, ML-) and the contents of the USER-MISC package have been moved to appropriate existing or new packages. There are now EXTRA-PAIR, EXTRA-COMPUTE, EXTRA-FIX, EXTRA-DUMP, EXTRA-MOLECULE packages for the less commonly used styles. We recommend that *external* packages (i.e. those not included in the LAMMPS distribution) adopt a USER- prefix to make them recognizable as external package.\r\n* Refactored multi-cutoff neighbor list support resulting in significant performance improvements for polydisperse granular systems.\r\n* Continued improvements to the build systems, especially the CMake based version.\r\n* Refactored the handling of embedded citation strings to make them more visible.\r\n* Updates and additions to the programmer guide section of the manual including updated guidelines and information for contributing code to LAMMPS.\r\n* Add support for using clang-format in the `src` tree with a configuration file and suitable comments in the source files. This is recommended for new contributions and will be gradually applied to existing .cpp files as the reformatting can interfere with the readability in some cases.\r\n* Scripts to support building LAMMPS and its documentation via CMake on systems without direct internet access.\r\n\r\n## Updates and new commands or styles or packages:\r\n* Expanded support for machine learning potentials in the ML-IAP package and the added ML-HDNNP, ML-PACE, ML-RANN packages\r\n* New MDI package to allow client/server mode coupling of LAMMPS to other code using the MolSSI Driver Interface API\r\n* New BROWNIAN package for Brownian dynamics time integration of point and extended particles plus updates for fix propel/self\r\n* New DIELECTRIC package with boundary element solvers for computing induced charges at interfaces\r\n* Major refactoring of the REAXFF package to eliminate dead code and inconsistencies, modernize force field file parsing, and correctly handle computing of the virial stress under different settings and with OpenMP\r\n* Updates to the library interface and corresponding changes to the LAMMPS python module: bug fixes, additional introspection support and support for setting callbacks for `fix external` and other associated properties with C and Python callbacks/functions possible.\r\n* Updated GPU package with improved support for OpenCL which enables using the GPU package with GPUs embedded in Intel processors (Iris, UHD, and HD graphics using the \"NEO\" OpenCL runtime).\r\n* Diverse updates, performance improvements, and bugfixes for the following packages: DRUDE, PLUMED, COLVARS, KOKKOS, KIM, ML-IAP, SNAP, REACTION\r\n* Many bugfixes, updates, and individual contributed commands and styles.\r\n\r\n## Backward compatibility notes:\r\n* The LAMMPS python module is now a folder with multiple Python script files instead of a single lammps.py file. This should not affect how the module can be used \"in-place\" by setting environment variables. The python module contains a version check that should help detecting when a LAMMPS shared library that does not match the python module.\r\n* Multi-cutoff neighbor list and communication is using a new and more flexible code path with a few additional constraints over the old code path, which is still available as a backup that must be explicitly requested.\r\n* KIM package commands have been reorganized into a single wrapper and multiple sub-commands: `kim_<something>` has become `kim <something>`\r\n* The CMake preset \"minimal\" has been renamed to \"basic\". There are no more \"make yes/no-standard\" and \"make yes/no-user\" due to the package reorganization; instead \"make yes/no-basic\" and a \"make yes/no-most\" targets have been added to reflect the corresponding CMake presets\r\n",

Once the stable release is out, you will have to maintain such changes as external patches until the next stable release or package a following patch release with those changes included.\r\n\r\nChanges since the 31 August 2021 patch release:\r\n- Updates and additions to the programmer guide section of the manual. Specifically, updated guidelines and information for contributing code to LAMMPS (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2927 \r\n- Add new command line flag `-skiprun` testing input files for syntax error as this will skip main loops in run, minimize and similar commands PR #2919 \r\n- Avoid crashes when loading modules like NumPy multiple times into deleted/cleared LAMMPS instances.  For that Py_Finalize() needs to be treated like MPI_Finalize() and thus called from main.cpp or a wrapper function in the library interface (Axel Kohlmeyer and Richard Berger, Temple U) PR #2923 \r\n- Many small bug fixes, minor code improvements, and coding style, build system, documentation, formatting updates (multiple authors) PR #2919, PR #2924, PR #2925, PR #2929, PR #2935, PR #2939, PR #2941\r\n"

The existing ttm fixes are refactored and modernized. This also generalizes and unbundles the grid communication class from the KSPACE package and thus updates all PPPM and MSM kspace style variants accordingly (Steve Plimpton, SNL) #2902 \r\n- New pair style coul/exclude to remove excluded Coulomb interactions to be used with kspace style scafacos for molecular systems (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2886 \r\n- Add functionality to fix property/atom to support per-atom arrays in addition to per-atom vectors (Steve Plimpton SNL) PR #2342, PR #2889 PR #2903 \r\n- Update the COLVARS package to version 2021-08-06 (Giacomo Fiorin, NIH, and the colvars developers) PR #2863 and PR #2866 \r\n- Update to fix bond/swap to support a second kind of bond swapping model (Steve Plimpton, SNL) PR #2888 \r\n- File reader refactor, bug fixes, and unit tests for INTERLAYER package pair styles (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2879, PR #2897 \r\n- Optimizations for SNAP with KOKKOS for large systems (enabled via config option) (Evan Weinberg, Nvidia) PR #2905 \r\n- Various updates and bugfixes for the KOKKOS package (Stan Moore, SNL) PR #2890, #2900 \r\n- Update factory functions to create or replace fixes and computes to return a pointer to the created class instance (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2869 \r\n- Updates to the introductory pages of the LAMMPS documentation (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2893 \r\n- Many small bug fixes, minor code improvements, and coding style, build system, documentation, formatting updates (multiple authors) PR #2804, PR #2862, PR #2861, PR #2865, PR #2868, PR #2876, PR #2880, PR #2881, PR #2885, PR #2887, PR #2889, PR #2891 , PR #2895, PR #2896, PR #2904, PR #2908, PR #2909, PR #2910, PR #2911, PR #2912, PR #2913, PR #2914\r\n\r\nBackward compatibility notices:\r\n- MC package fixes `atom/swap`, `gcmc`, `widom`, and `charge/regulation` were under some circumstances calling fixes that normally would be called at the \"end_of_step()\" stage during a time step instead in the \"pre_exchange()\" stage. This could lead to unexpected output or use of data from the previous time step (e.g. with fix print, fix ave/time etc.).

The USER-MISC package has been removed and its contents distributed to existing packages or one of the new packages INTERLAYER, ORIENT, EXTRA-COMPUTE, EXTRA-DUMP, EXTRA-FIX, EXTRA-MOLECULE, EXTRA-PAIR. Also some styles from MISC, MOLECULE and the src folder have been moved to more suitable packages. In case you are missing a style in your executable, LAMMPS should report which package contains the missing style and needs to be added.\r\n- Some semantics of the fix external support functions to set global energy and virial have been changed to be more consistent."

Also some packages have been renamed to better represent their content and also to group similar ones (e.g. machine learning or coarse grain or DPD packages). Some more reorganization of individual style files will follow in the next patch release.\r\n- There is a new package (DPD-BASIC) and several dpd pair styles have been moved there from USER-MISC or the src folder.\r\n- The \"minimal.cmake\" preset has been renamed to \"basic.cmake\" to match the corresponding \"yes/no-basic\" target in the conventional build and to avoid conflicts.\r\n"

    "body": "Changes since the patch release 10 February 2021:\r\n- Major update of the GPU package with significant performance and compatibility improvements (Mike Brown and Nitin Dhamankar, Intel Corp.) PR #2603, PR #2610, use statically linked OpenCL driver loader with CMake (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2617, HIP compilation fixes (Richard Berger, Temple U) PR #2622\r\n- New pair style lj/relres which allows fine-grained/coarse-grained simulations for lj/cut type interactions (Mark Chaimovich, Russian School of Mathematics, and Aviel Chaimovich, Drexel University) PR #2590 \r\n- Refactoring of the KIM package commands. Instead of multiple `kim_<something>` commands there is now only the `kim` command which accepts `<something>` as subcommand. Additional cleanups and improvements to the kim commands (Yaser Afshar, Ryan S. Elliott, Ellad Tadmor UMN) PR #2620, PR #2625, PR #2649 \r\n- Direct support for neural network (nn) models added to MLIAP package (Pedro Antonio Santos Florez, University of Nevada - Las Vegas) PR #2641 \r\n- Multiple small improvements and bugfixes to the USER-REACTION package (Jake Gissinger, NASA) PR #2600, PR #2616, PR #2627\r\n- Reader classes for LAMMPS log files and fix ave/chunk output added to the LAMMPS Python module (Richard Berger, Temple U) PR #2631\r\n- Unit tester tools for dihedrals and impropers with inputs for most styles (Abhishek Shandilya, RPI and Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2290 \r\n- Cleanup and small performance updates for SNAP support in KOKKOS on GPU (Evan Weinberg, Nvidia) PR #2599 \r\n- Various small bug fixes, coding style and formatting updates (multiple authors) PR #2601, PR #2602, PR #2604, PR #2609, PR #2612, PR #2613, PR #2614, PR #2615, PR #2618, PR #2624, PR #2629, PR #2632, PR #2633, PR #2634, PR #2635, PR #2637, PR #2638, PR #2644, PR #2651, PR #2652\r\n\r\nBackward compatibility notes:\r\n- The STUBS library is compiled with C++ so there are no symbol name collisions when a serial LAMMPS library and mpi4py are loaded into a Python interpreter at the same time\r\n- All KIM package commands of the kind `kim_<command>` are renamed to `kim <command>`\r\n- There are several changes to the package gpu command:\r\n  - The Ngpu parameter to the package now accepts 0 (for automatic determination of number of GPUs)\r\n  - The gpuID keyword now only takes 1 argument.\r\n  - The device keyword is replaced with 'platform' and 'device_type'\r\n  - The automatic OpenCL platform detection will choose the platform with the best GPU (in terms of compute cores)\r\n  - OpenCL, device configuration parameters for NVIDIA, AMD, INTEL are automatically determined at runtime\r\n  More details about this are in the manual\r\n- Since the changes to the GPU package were substantial, some remaining bugs and compatibility issues are to be expected"

    "body": "Changes since the patch release 24 December 2020:\r\n- Add support for machine learning potentials using python frameworks to the MLIAP package (Nicholas Lubbers, LANL, and Aidan Thompson, SNL) PR #2508\r\n- Add 'shift' keyword for multiple Tersoff pair style variants to allow adjusting lattice constants in the case of hetero materials (Wengen Ouyang, Tel Aviv University, Davide Mandelli, Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Aidan Thompson, SNL) PR #2514 \r\n- New 'eam/he' pair style for modeling He bubbles in metals (Xiaowang Zhou, SNL) PR #2556\r\n- New Wang-Frenkel pair style ('wf/cut'), a smooth, short range Lennard-Jones like potential (Xipeng Wang and Simón Ramírez-Hinestrosa, Chinese Academy of Sciences, U Cambridge) PR #2435 \r\n- New potential files in version 2 format for the AGNI pair style and support for reading/processing those potential files (James Chapman, Lawrence Livermore National Lab) PR #2479 \r\n- Update of bundled Kokkos library to version 3.3.1 (Stan Moore, SNL, and the Kokkos developers) PR #2540 \r\n- Optimizations for running SNAP potentials with KOKKOS on GPUs (Evan Weinberg, Nvidia) PR #2549\r\n- Add capability to fix bond/react to have reactions create atoms (Jake Gissinger, NASA) PR #2584\r\n- Standardize the way how contributions from fix styles to energy and virial are handled. Remove THERMO_ENERGY fix mask. (Steve Plimpton, SNL) PR #2560 \r\n- Replace redundant 3-vector inline functions from pair styles and `math_vector.h` with calls to `MathExtra` namespace functions. Obsolete `math_vector.h` and `math_complex.h` header files that were using common c++ class names without a protecting namespace (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2558\r\n- More granular control over communication for pair style and fixes with KOKKOS (Stan Moore, SNL) PR #2532 \r\n- Refactor processing of embedded citation strings to make them more visible (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U and Steve Plimpton, SNL) PR #2545 \r\n- Add introspection support for compile time settings of accelerator packages (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U), PR #2554\r\n- Add ArgInfo class for simpler processing of references to computes, fixes, variables and more. Refactor the code using those (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2571\r\n- Add `utils::strdup()`` convenience function and apply it to many files to collapse repetitive multi-line code to a single line (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2583\r\n- Detect non-ASCII characters in input and try to correct known cases where equivalent UTF-8 characters are used (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2564 \r\n- Add version check to the LAMMPS python module so that the version of the python module must match the version in the shared library. (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2589\r\n- Change sign conventions for forward/reverse Fourier transforms in LAMMPS to be aligned with common conventions (Steve Plimpton and Stan Moore, SNL) PR #2506 \r\n- Move definition of \"INVOKED_*\" bitmap constants to an enumerator in the compute.h header file for consistency (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2572\r\n- Add to CI checks runs via GitHub Actions (instead of Jenkins on ci.lammps.org): Static code analysis for C++ and Python via CodeQL, and compilation and unit tests on MacOS. (Axel Kohlmeyer and Richard Berger, Temple U) PR #2401 \r\n- Various small bug fixes, coding style and formatting updates (multiple authors) PR #2547, PR #2553, PR #2555, PR #2557, PR #2559, PR #2561, PR #2562, PR #2565, PR #2566, PR #2567, PR #2569, PR #2576, PR #2579, PR #2580, PR #2582, PR #2586, PR #2591, PR #2592, #2594, #2596\r\n\r\nBackward compatibility notice:\r\n- the processing and meaning of `fix_modify energy` and `fix_modify virial` has been changed. It is now **only** available for fixes that contribute to the potential energy and the virial. The energy contributions from thermostats and similar fixes can be accessed with the thermo keyword `ecouple` and the conserved quantity (i.e. etotal + ecouple) is available as `econserve`. There are corresponding changes to the implementation, so external fixes will have to be adapted or they will no longer compile. All affected fixes in the LAMMPS distribution have been updated.\r\n- the LAMMPS python module now contains a version check: When installing the python module, the current LAMMPS version is stored in a `__version__` module variable and upon initialization of a LAMMPS instance it is checked against the output from the `lammps.version()` method which returns the version of the loaded shared library. If they don't match an exception is raised. This helps to detect inconsistent installations of the shared library or module or incorrectly setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or `PYTHONPATH`.\r\n- Arguments to LAMMPS commands that contain references to compute, fixes, or variables (`c_ID`, `f_ID`, `v_ID` with and without indices) are now more strictly checked for correctness. Inputs that are incorrect but have previously worked by chance will now cause failures.\r\n- the KOKKOS package option \"cuda/aware\" has been renamed to \"gpu/aware\" since Kokkos now also supports AMD GPUs via HIP.\r\n- this release has several \"invasive\" changes to core parts of LAMMPS, so there is an increased risk that something has been broken in a part of the code that is not (yet) covered by our automated tests (which currently cover about 1/3rd of the total code base)."

    "body": "This stable release corresponds to a significantly larger number of changes than between previous stable releases. There have been over 4000 commits added since the last stable release, while the two previous stable releases have been made after fewer than 2000 commits.\r\n\r\n### Below is a list of major changes since the last stable release 3 March 2020\r\n\r\n## General changes:\r\n* Significant refactoring of the core LAMMPS code to increase code reuse, simplify new additions, improve thread safety, and benefit from C++11 features. In particular the following changes were incorporated:\r\n  + Refactoring of the AtomVec classes to simplify adding new atom styles to the code. Also adding support for writing complete data files for atom styles ellipsoid, line, tri, and body, which had been previously missing.\r\n  + Implementation of string tokenizer and potential file reader classes to improve parsing of text files and avoid the `strtok()` function. This has lead to substantial reduction in the lines of code used for those cases.\r\n  + Transferring of utility function from class members to standalone functions in the `utils` namespace. Several new additions of such convenience functions\r\n  + Using `const std::string &`  instead `char *` or `const char *` as function argument in many places to simplify string processing and replacing C style string functions with their equivalent or expanded functionality of `std::string` member functions\r\n  + Incorporation of fmtlib to replace and simplify many cases of output formatting. This avoids many complications with `printf()` style functions since no special treatment is required for processing bigint or tagint arguments. Since fmtlib has been accepted as a C++20 feature, this is also future proofing the code base.\r\n  + Avoiding use of temporary local buffers for output formatting and thus lowering the risk of buffer overflows. This was enabled by the previous two changed.\r\n  + Replacing `NULL` with `nullptr` where applicable for better detection of incorrect use.\r\n* Major reorganization and significant expansion of the manual:\r\n  + The manual is now split into two parts: a User Guide and a Programmer Guide\r\n  + Most of the content related to using the library interfaces, the Python module (and Python in general) have been moved to the Programmer Guide\r\n  + The content of the external Developer Guide PDF has been incorporated into the Programmer Guide section and expanded\r\n  + The documentation of the C-library interface and Python module has been expanded and the documentation of the individual APIs are now imported from the source code by means of using doxygen (for C/C++) and docstrings (for Python).\r\n  + Redundancies have been reduced, cross-links added, and links to external websites checked, updated or removed.\r\n* Addition of a unit test facility which is integrated into building LAMMPS with CMake and using the `ctest` tool that comes with CMake. Tests for a variety of features and styles are included with a code coverage close to 40%. The added tests have exposed a significant number of previously unknown bugs and inconsistencies (e.g. between plain pair styles and suffixed versions or between `Pair::compute()` and `Pair::single()`) in the code base, which have been fixed.\r\n* Significant refactoring of the LAMMPS C-library interface and Python module: several new functions were added, especially for introspection, ad-hoc numerical constants were replaced by symbolic constants defined in enumerators and synchronized betwee C and Python, where possible and needed. Most modifications were done in a backward compatible way.\r\n* Add support for a \"UNITS:\" metadata tag to potential and tabulation files and code to error out if the value does not match with the current setting. For some potentials, mainly manybody potentials, support for on-the-fly conversion between \"metal\" and \"real\" units was added, so that a file with parameters for \"metal\" units can be used in a simulation with \"real\" units, if the pair style supports it.\r\n* Ordering of `#include \"\"` statements has been revised and the lists updated where possible after analyzing with the IWYU tool.\r\n* Significant refactoring of CMake scripts enabled by moving the minimum required CMake version from 2.8.x to 3.10.x. CMake build support is more reliable, portable to different host operating systems and efficient.\r\n* Conventional build system now always builds the LAMMPS library and the executable, so the available modes are reduced from 4 to 2: mode=static and mode=shared. The CMake build behaves equivalently.\r\n* Use pre-processor macros (requiring C++11) to provide compatibility with OpenMP 4.x and later semantics\r\n* **Many** small fixes and improvements.\r\n* Removal of outdated or obsolete makefiles. Removal of obsolete files and folder in the bench folder.\r\n\r\n## Updates and new commands or styles or packages:\r\n* New MLIAP package providing a generalized framework for machine-learning potentials. This currently includes an implementation of the SNAP potential\r\n* New USER-MESONT package for mesoscale modeling of nanotubes.\r\n* New command `reset_mol_ids`\r\n* New `fix widom` for modeling Widom insertions\r\n* New `fix pafi` to perform langevin or brownian dynamics time integration constrained to a potential hyperplane. Intended to be coupled to the PAFI C++ code.\r\n* Bugfixes, improved documentation, and new functionality for `fix bond/react` in particular RMSD based constraints.\r\n* New `fix accelerate/cos` and `compute viscosity/cos` in USER-MISC as yet another method to compute viscosity.\r\n* New `fix momentum/chunk` to remove per chunk momentum\r\n* New bond style `special` to provide a mechanism to implement special bond exclusions beyond 1-4.\r\n* Ports of more functionality to the KOKKOS package and several performance optimizations. Support for AMD GPUs via HIP. Update of the bundled Kokkos library to version 3.2.\r\n* Support for triclinic cells when using \"tiled\" communication style.\r\n* New pair style for charge-dipole damping with Tang-Toennies function in the USER-DRUDE package\r\n* Updates, bugfixes and adjustments to LAMMPS requiring C++11 in the USER-COLVARS package (now at version 2020-09-17).\r\n* Support for building triclinic neighbor lists on the GPU in the GPU package. Bugfixes and performance improvements for GPU styles.\r\n* Updates to writing binary dump files and `binary2atom` tool to become consistent with current text mode custom dumps\r\n* Updates to the user supported `examples/COUPLE/fortran` and `examples/COUPLE/fortran2` wrappers to become compatible with updates to the C-library interface. Also work on a new, \"object oriented\" Fortran interface has started.\r\n* New LAMMPS shell command as alternative to the regular LAMMPS executable for improved interactive use.\r\n* Interface file for use with SWIG to create bindings to the LAMMPS library interface for a wide variety of (mostly scripted) programming languages (like Java, JavaScript, Lua, Perl, Ruby, Tcl and more).\r\n* Improved support for cross-compiling binaries for Windows on Linux. This enables building a liblammps.dll file and loading the LAMMPS Python module also on Windows.\r\n* Improved CMake support for building with \"ninja\" instead of \"make\".\r\n\r\n## Backward compatibility notes:\r\n- A C++11 compatible compiler is now required\r\n- CMake 3.10 or later is required for configuring and building with CMake\r\n- The USER-MESO package was renamed to USER-MESODPD to avoid confusion\r\n- Fix bond/react has been moved from USER-MISC to its own USER-REACTION package\r\n- The command `reset_ids` was renamed to `reset_atom_ids`.\r\n- Binary restarts using pair styles ufm, buck/mdf, lennard/mdf, coul/shield, coul/diel, and morse/soft are not compatible with older versions of LAMMPS due to bugfixes in the restart handling of those pair styles.\r\n- The format of binary dump files has changed. binary2text can detect and convert the old and the new format\r\n- Fixes temp/berendsen, temp/csvr, temp/csld, temp/rescale, fix spring/chunk and fix spring/rg now store their state in binary restart files\r\n\r\n"

Because of that we are particularly interested in problems with building LAMMPS on different platforms and formatting issues of the new parts of the manual, or problems building it.

Also it should be noted, that calling `lammps_open_no_mpi()` is equivalent to calling `lammps_open()` with MPI_COMM_WORLD, so `lammps_open()` is really only needed when running LAMMPS on a subset of the MPI ranks with a custom communicator created by `MPI_Comm_split()` as demonstrated in `examples/COUPLE/simple/simple.c`"

(E. Anne Gunn, Sheridan College) PR #2358 \r\n- Replace numeric constants in Atom and AtomVec classes by symbolic ones via enumerators (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2360 \r\n- Bugfixes for the GPU package and related CMake/make files (Vsevolod Nikolskiy, HSE University Moscow and Trung Nguyen, Northwestern U), PR #2307, PR #2313, PR #2322, PR #2326\r\n- Bugfix for Langevin thermostatting inside of multiple fix rigid variants (Trung Nguyen, Northwestern U) PR #2367 \r\n- Refactoring of the C library interface and the Python wrapper for consistency and maintainability, unit test support for the interfaces, decoration of library functions with Doxygen comments for semi-automatic documentation in the manual (Axel Kohlmeyer and Richard Berger, Temple U) PR #2310, PR #2318, PR #2320, PR #2357, PR #2359, PR #2362\r\n- Update of documentation build system to include Doxygen processing and integration of that output via the \"breathe\" Sphinx extension inclusion of the Developer Guide in the manual, update and corrections to the CMake support (Axel Kohlmeyer and Richard Berger, Temple U) PR #2309, PR #2312, PR #2327 \r\n- Update headers in the documentation of LAMMPS style commands to be more compact and check for missing index entries (Richard Berger, Temple U) PR #2335\r\n- Update the compilation related documentation to use the sphinx-tabs extension (in HTML mode only) to make it more compact (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2348 \r\n- Revised internal and external links in the documentation (Matt Mansell and others) PR #2341\r\n- Move more convenience functions from classes to the utils namespace, update the code to consistently use the new versions and remove the old, update the manual to include the documentation of those APIs into the developer guide (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2319, PR #2349 \r\n- Start of a new (and \"official\") Fortran library interface and corresponding sphinx API documentation in the programmer guide plus unit tests for implemented APIs (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2325\r\n- Update include file conventions and update lists of include files accordingly, add `make iwyu` target to run the include-what-you-use tool (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2338 \r\n- Make internal memory usage reporting consistently use the same data type (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2363\r\n- Add support to call reset_mol_ids internally from fix bond/react (Jake Gissinger, U Colorado), PR #2240 \r\n- Add RMSD based constraint to fix bond/react (Jake Gissinger, U Collorado, and Andrew Jewett, Scripps, and Yuya Kurebayashi, Tohoku U) PR #2314 \r\n- Refactor of USER-BOCS code to fix memory leaks and memory access issues (E.

The use of a `void **` argument to `lammps_open()` and similar functions is deprecated and the `void *` return value should be used instead. Also it implements some symbolic constants that should replace the explicit numbers from previous revisions of the API (the values are unchanged).\r\n- The LAMMPS python module follows the changes of the C library interface. Data types and dimensions for \"extract\" functions are queried from the LAMMPS library and automatically applied, but the old style methods setting the data types explicitly should still work for the time being.\r\n- When using CMake and compiling with the KOKKOS package enabled, the CMakeCache.txt file needs to be removed due to deprecation of variables in the updated Kokkos library CMake scripts"
