    "body": "Below is a list of major changes since the last stable release 2 August 2023\r\n\r\nThis stable release adds about 3800 commits since the previous stable release. This includes many contributions from beyond the core LAMMPS developers, but also continues the internal refactoring of the code base to make it more consistent and reliable yet also take more advantage of C++ features where they help to simplify the code and easier to modify, maintain, and contribute to.\r\nSince the last stable release the [LAMMPS core team has grown](https://www.lammps.org/authors.html), so there are now more eyes and hands taking care of LAMMPS.\r\n\r\n## General Changes\r\n- Continued refactoring of the core LAMMPS code and many packages to increase code reuse, simplify new additions, improve consistency, and benefit from C++11 features. Several convenience functions and classes were added in the process.\r\n- Continued improving of error message to be more specific and provide more hints about what went wrong.\r\n- Enhancements and extensions of the Programmer' Guide section of the manual.\r\n- Significant enhancements to LAMMPS-GUI and support for packaging of LAMMPS-GUI and LAMMPS on a variety of platforms.\r\n- Expanded CTest based internal testing.\r\n- CMake build requires at least CMake version 3.16.\r\n- The -DLAMMPS_EXCEPTIONS setting is now always active.\r\n- Compiling the KOKKOS package requires a C++17 compatible compiler.\r\n\r\n## Updates and new commands or styles or packages (for more details see the individual release announcements):\r\n- New RHEO package reproducing hydrodynamics and elastic objects (i.e. an improved version of SPH that can work in combination with BPM)\r\n- New ML-UF3 package with pair style uf3 implementing the ultra-fast forcefield (uf3) machine learned interatomic potential. A KOKKOS version is included as well. \r\n- New fix wall/flow command which provides flow boundary conditions\r\n- New fix deform/pressure command for expanded deformation controls\r\n- New angle and dihedral styles cosine/squared/restricted for use with the MARTINI force field\r\n- New pair style pedone for the non-Coulomb part of the Pedone (PMMCS) potential\r\n- New pair style hybrid/molecular which allows different pair styles (or pair_coeffs) for inter- and intra-molecular interactions\r\n- New compute pace command for evaluating ACE descriptors which functions similar to compute snap\r\n- New compute to identify under-coordinated particles (rattlers) \r\n- New fix to measure the nonaffine displacement of particles\r\n- New compute slcsa/atom for supervised learning structural analysis\r\n- New per-atom compute to calculate local atom type compositions\r\n- New fix press/langevin command for a langevin based barostat\r\n- New pair style nb3b/screened which computes a screened angle interactions compared to nb3b/harmonic\r\n- Ports of several pair, bond, angle, dihedral, improper, and fix styles to KOKKOS\r\n- Bundled Kokkos library is updated for version 4.3.1\r\n- Enhancements and bug fixes for the SPH package\r\n- Updates to the COLVARS package\r\n- Updates to the ML-POD package\r\n- Updates for the ELECTRODE package \r\n- Enhancements for running LAMMPS with very large atomic or molecular systems across a very large number of processors\r\n- Significantly expanded support for using typelabels\r\n- Add functionality to build the PLUMED as a plugin so it can be provided in binary distributions, e.g. on Windows\r\n- Add support for using the heFFTe library to do FFTs\r\n- Updates for multiple INTERLAYER potential files and bugfixes for a couple of pair styles in the package\r\n- Add Born matrix support to more potentials \r\n- Inclusion of angle and dihedral contribution to compuite stress/mop and stress/mop/profile\r\n- Enhancements to fix pimd/langevin\r\n- Add option to do anti-aliasing for better image quality with dump image and dump movie\r\n- Update bundled libfmt code to version 10.1.1\r\n\r\n## Removed features\r\n- The lammps-shell is no longer included. Use LAMMPS-GUI in its place.\r\n- The (outdated) i-PI distribution was removed from tools folder. It can be downloaded using pip instead.\r\n- The \"reax/c\" alias to provide backward compatibility for \"reaxff\" commands and keywords has been (finally) removed. Now using \"reaxff\" is *required*.\r\n- The obsolete MSCG package was removed\r\n- The unmaintained and unreliable MPIIO package was removed\r\n",

    "body": "Changes since the 17 April 2024 release:\r\n\r\n- Add generalized algorithm for `replicate` command to correctly replicate molecules across periodic boundaries box (Jacob Gissinger, Stevens Institute of Technology) PR #3118\r\n- Add `overlap` keyword to `create_atoms` command which searches for overlaps on an atom-by-atom basis when inserting molecules (Jacob Gissinger, Stevens Institute of Technology) PR #3810\r\n- Add coefficient of restitution based damping in granular models (Dhairya Vyas, Northwestern University) PR #4068\r\n- Make `compute stress/mop` and `stress/mop/profile` compatible with 2D systems (Evangelos Voyiatzis, Novamechanics Ltd) #4159\r\n- Update Kokkos library version in LAMMPS to v4.3.1 (Stan Moore, SNL, and Kokkos developers) PR #4162\r\n- Add special variable functions `sort()` and `rsort()` for sorting vectors by value (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #4171\r\n- Add support for extracting a few more properties and the `Atom::map()` function to the library interface (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #4174\r\n- Add KOKKOS package support for hybrid bonds (Stan Moore, SNL) PR #4167\r\n- Updates to ML-POD package and port of pair style pod to KOKKOS (Ngoc Cuong Nguyen, MIT) PR #4168 \r\n- New option for the CG-DNA package to read potential parameters from a potential file and support for \"real\" units in addition to \"lj\" (Kierran Falloon and Oliver Henrich, University of Strathclyde) PR #4169 \r\n- New pair style `dpd/coul/slater/long` including GPU package version (Eddy Barraud, IFPEN/Sorbonne) PR #4188 \r\n- New ML-UF3 package with pair style `uf3` implementing the ultra-fast forcefield (uf3) machine learned interatomic potential. A KOKKOS version is included as well. Ajinkya C Hire (University of Florida), Hendrik Kraß (University of Constance), Matthias Rupp (Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology) PR #4110 \r\nRichard Hennig (University of Florida)\r\n- New pair style `hybrid/molecular` which allows different pair styles (or pair_coeffs) for inter- and intra-molecular interactions (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #4191 \r\n- Add KOKKOS package version of `pair_style soft` (Stan Moore, SNL) PR #4184 \r\n- Add support for type labels to a whole lot of commands and styles (Jake Gissinger, Stevens Institute of Technology) PR #4145 \r\n- Many small bug fixes, minor code improvements and refactoring, and updates for coding style, build system, documentation, and formatting (multiple authors) PR #3824, PR #4050, PR #4142, PR #4144, PR #4146, PR #4148, PR #4150, PR #4152, PR #4157, PR #4161, PR #4164, PR #4166, PR #4172, PR #4176, PR #4179, PR #4185, PR #4189, PR #4192, PR #4193, PR #4195, PR #4197, PR #4200, PR #4201, PR #4202, PR #4203, PR #4204\r\n\r\nBackward compatibility notes:\r\n\r\n- When using `fix qeq/reaxff` and `fix qeq/shielded`, more thorough checks are applied that QEq is not used on atoms in the fix group without parameters being provided. This will primarily apply to simulations using ReaxFF as sub-style of pair style hybrid.\r\n- The `i-PI` distribution was removed from `tools` folder. It can be downloaded using `pip` instead\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "This is the second update to the 2 August 2023 stable release that fixes bugs that have been reported since then and updates some libraries, dependencies, tools, and build system support.\r\n\r\nThe following individual changes are included:\r\n- enforce consistent OpenMP threads settings for /omp styles (avoids crashes and memory corruption)\r\n- accept very old style ReaxFF force field that are missing the ovc property for bonds and set it to 0.0 (it is 0.0 most of the time anyway) \r\n- avoid segfaults when querying LAMMPS for thermo data before the Thermo class has been instantiated\r\n- identify Windows 11 23H2\r\n- bugfix to ellipsoid region for correct forces with fix wall/region\r\n- bugfix and updates to computes cluster/atom, aggregate/atom, and fragment/atom to add missing communication of ghost atoms and to avoid deadlocks\r\n- fix cut-n-paste type in minimize style error message\r\n- update CWD in LAMMPS GUI also when saving a buffer\r\n- fix bug in LAMMPS GUI where the number of threads could not be increased\r\n- fix delete/delete[] mismatch in LAMMPS GUI\r\n- check LAMMPS library loaded as plugin to be compatible with LAMMPS GUI\r\n- bugfix for neighbor list trimming on requests that request neighbors of ghosts \r\n- properly quote keywords containing special characters in dump yaml output\r\n- detect more cases of inconsistent KOKKOS style usage and error out gracefully\r\n- add sanity check to `python/install.py` file and improve readability of error messages\r\n- if `tools/phonon/phana` uses `linalg`, make sure it is built before linking\r\n- nullify deleted pointers when creating styles in Force or Update since the creation may fail and trigger an exception and the we may run into a double free error crashing the application\r\n- avoid \"invalid escape\" warning with python 3.12\r\n- fix bug in fix pimd/langevin\r\n- make certain that generated argv lists are NULL terminated to avoid segfaults with OpenMPI 5.x and later\r\n- fix bug in pace/extrapolate\r\n- fix bug in the rigid fixes that was causing a drift in the z-coordinate with 2d systems\r\n- fix bugs in fix mvv/* compatibility checks\r\n- restore using nvcc_wrapper with kokkos_cuda.cmake preset\r\n- fix memory leak in dump style image and remove redundant code\r\n- the scale yes option is not supported with fix adapt/fep for atom charges and diameters, update list of supported pair styles, fix bug with global scale factor\r\n- Avoid segfault in fix atom/swap for systems without per-type masses. Warn if both per-type and per-atom masses are set that per-type masses will be used\r\n- correct DPI settings in mesh images for compute saed and compute xrd so the images display correctly in PDF files\r\n- avoid copying over terminating null byte in balance and fix balance shift keyword\r\n- may only check for region inside box in fix gcmc and fix widom if the region keyword was used\r\n- avoid deprecated python initialization for python 3.12 and later\r\n- avoid warnings from including multiple cython generated include files\r\n- add valgrind suppresions for MPICH",

(Steve Plimpton) PR #3896 \r\n- Multiple bug fixes, improvements, and added features for the LAMMPS GUI updating it to version 1.5 (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #3883, PR #3890, PR #3893, PR #3904, PR #3910, PR #3912, PR #3923 \r\n- Many small bug fixes, minor code improvements and refactoring, and updates for coding style, build system, documentation, and formatting (multiple authors) PR #3724, PR #3846, PR #3867, PR #3881, PR #3885, PR #3887, PR #3888, PR #3892, PR #3898, PR #3900, PR #3903, PR #3905, PR #3908, PR #3911, PR #3914, PR #3915, PR #3922, PR #3924, PR #3930, PR #3931, PR #3937, PR #3941, PR #3943, PR #3944, PR #3947, PR #3948, PR #3949, PR #3950, PR #3953, PR #3954, PR #3957, PR #3958, PR #3964, PR #3966, PR #3968, PR #3971, PR #3973, PR #3975, PR #3976, PR #3979, PR #3981  \r\n\r\nBackward compatibility notes:\r\n- The MSCG package and thus fix mscg has been removed\r\n- The MPIIO package has been removed. The corresponding dump styles are no longer available and .mpiio restarts cannot be read anymore\r\n- CMake version 3.16 or later is now required to build LAMMPS with CMake\r\n- A C++17 capable compiler is now required to compile the KOKKOS package\r\n- using a triclinic simulation cell now requires atom IDs due to changes in the neighbor list build algorithms\r\n- the refactoring of variable access to compute and fix data has the following consequences:\r\n  - the compute voronoi/atom peratom option was dropped; it now always produces peratom data. The local option is now used to also generate local data\r\n  - an inputs option was added to compute reduce to operation on peratom (default) or local data. You must use it to operate on local data\r\n  - the rules for equal, vector, atom-style variables changed a bit for how they access output from computes and fixes. An equal-style variable can access any kind of data, using C_ID, instead of c_ID (similar for fixes) to access per-atom data instead of global data. \r\n  - vector and atom-style varaiables can only access global vector and per-atom data directly. They can use an equal-style variable to access other kinds of data indirectly.\r\n"

    "body": "Below is a list of major changes since the last stable release 23 June 2022\r\n\r\nThis stable release adds about 5500 commits since the previous stable release. This includes many contributions from beyond the core LAMMPS developers, but also continues the internal refactoring of the code base to make it more consistent and reliable yet also take more advantage of C++ features where they help to simplify the code and easier to modify, maintain, and contribute to.\r\n\r\n## General Changes\r\n- Continued refactoring of the core LAMMPS code and many packages to increase code reuse, simplify new additions, improve consistency, and benefit from C++11 features. Several convenience functions and classes were added in the process.\r\n- Continued improving of error message to be more specific and provide more hints about what went wrong\r\n- Enhancements and extensions of the Programmer' Guide section of the manual. For example more information about programming conventions, a detailed example for writing pair styles from scratch, information about porting code for old LAMMPS versions to the current development version\r\n\r\n## Updates and new commands or styles or packages:\r\n- New AMOEBA package implementing the Amoeba and Hippo force fields (including GPU support)\r\n- New ML-POD package for machine learning potentials using \"proper orthogonal descriptors\"\r\n- New LEPTON package for defining the energy/forces for pair styles and fixes from text strings with analytical expressions\r\n- Basic support for symbolic types aka type labels\r\n- New LAMMPS GUI tool, a simple graphical text editor for input files with LAMMPS built in so the input can be run without a LAMMPS executable\r\n- New command `reset_atoms` that serves as a front end for `reset_atom_ids`, `reset_mol_ids` and the new `reset_atoms image` for reducing the value of image flags\r\n- New `angle_write` and `dihedral_write` commands to produce table files for use with the corresponding table styles\r\n- Replace overzealous checks that lead to \"Compute not current\" errors with more forgiving checks\r\n- Add support for setting and outputting vector style variables with a python-list-like format\r\n- Enhancements for PyLammps\r\n- New compute `efield/wolf/atom` command to approximate local electrical field for individual atoms\r\n- New `fix scgmc` command imported from the external USER-VCSGC package\r\n- New features and updates to the ELECTRODE package\r\n- Port of more fixes and pair styles to the KOKKOS package, most notably the MEAM and ML-IAP packages\r\n- Updates and bugfixes to the DIELECTRIC package\r\n- Update COLVARS package to version 2023-05-01\r\n- Improvements to the MDI package with more functionality\r\n- Updates and refactoring of the GRANULAR package to make it more consistent and flexible\r\n- Updates to the ML-PACE package\r\n- CG-SDK package was rename to CG-SPICA and some enhancements added\r\n- The bundled linalg library (a subset of LAPACK and BLAS) was converted from Fortran to C++ so LAMMPS can be more easily compiled on platforms that do not have a Fortran compiler or a ready-to-use BLAS/LAPACK installation\r\n- Update bundled Kokkos library to version 3.7.2\r\n- Update bundled fmtlib files to version 9.1.0\r\n- New `fix pair` command to access per-atom data computed by pair styles\r\n- New pair styles `xlz` and `born/gauss`\r\n- New `fix pimd/langevin` for path-integral simulations using a Langevin thermostat\r\n- New `fix alchemy` and `compute pressure/alchemy` commands for multi-partition alchemical transformations\r\n- New bond style `harmonic/restrain` to restrain bonds to their current length\r\n- New pair styles `lj/cut/sphere`, `lj/expand/sphere`, and `lepton/sphere` which use the individual particle diameter from atom style sphere as a potential property instead of a per-type pair_coeff setting \r\n- New pair style `aip/water/2dm` for interfaces between water and 2d materials\r\n- Support more pair, bond, and angle styles with compute born/matrix\r\n- Updates, enhancements, and bugfixes for the BPM package\r\n- Multiple bugfixes and enhancements for the INTEL package\r\n- Add unified Python interface for ML-IAP package including Kokkos support\r\n- Support using `fix shake` and `fix rattle` during minimization. The constraints are replaced by strong restraint forces\r\n- Update of pair style mesocnt to include all functionality and some additions over the corresponding fortran versions. The latter are thus obsolete and were removed.\r\n- Updates to the LAMMPS Fortran module. This is now complete and thus the obsolete older modules/wrappers were removed since they were in need of updating.\r\n- Various GPU package improvements and bug fixes\r\n- Refactoring of distributed grids making some of that data also accessible for computes and dumps\r\n\r\n## Backward compatibility notices:\r\n- The CG-SDK package is now called CG-SPICA\r\n- The LATTE package and fix latter are removed. Its functionality is provided by the MDI package\r\n- the default setting for neighbor list rebuilds has been changed from delay 10 to delay 0\r\n- Unlike other variables, atomfile style variables are now deleted with the clear command\r\n- The internal fix STORE command has been split into fix STORE/GLOBAL and fix STORE/PERATOM\r\n- Obsolete Fortran interfaces to the LAMMPS C-library interface were removed\r\n- `fix pimd` was renamed to `fix pimd/nvt`\r\n- pair style `mesont/tpm`, compute style `mesont`, and atom style `mesont` were removed\r\n- make install in a CMake based installation will no longer install the LAMMPS python module. make install-python can be used for that.\r\n",

This can lead to old inputs failing because of invalid numbers\r\n- The `Si.b.meam.sw.spline` had to be corrected for an invalid floating-point number (see previous note. here the \"e\" in the exponent was missing and thus the exponent was incorrectly ignored). Most calculations, but not all, will be unaffected since this only concerned the spline coefficients at the very beginning of the table.\r\n- The syntax for the `python source` command has changed slightly to be more consistent with the other features of the command.\r\n- The commands `reset_atom_ids` and `reset_mol_ids` have been renamed to `reset_atoms id` and `reset_atoms mol`, respectively. When the original commands are used, a warning is printed and the commands changed to the new versions.\r\n- The `box` command has been removed. The error check that it was used for to disable has been changed to a warning. If the box command is used, it is ignored and a warning is printed.\r\n- Binary restarts written with KOKKOS enabled for older versions of LAMMPS may not read back correctly with this version due an inconsistency in the restart output. Those restarts must be converted into data files using the old executable to be readable.",

    "body": "Below is a list of major changes since the last stable release 29 September 2021\r\n\r\nThis stable release adds about 3000 commits since the previous stable release. This includes many contributions from beyond the core LAMMPS developers, but also continues the internal refactoring of the code base to make it more consistent and reliable yet also take more advantage of C++ features where they help to simplify the code and easier to modify, maintain, and contribute to.\r\n\r\nWith this release we will remove the previously used branches `master` and `unstable` and use the current equivalents `develop` and `release`. The `stable` keeps its name, but since we published bugfix updates to the last stable release it will now run parallel to `develop` and be explicitly synchronized with it (technically speaking, the patch_23Jun2022 and the stable_23Jun2022 tags will point to different commit hashes due to the difference in their histories, but the content will be identical).\r\n\r\n## General Changes\r\n\r\n- Continued refactoring of the core LAMMPS code and many packages to increase code reuse, simplify new additions, improve consistency, and benefit from C++11 features. Several convenience functions and classes were added in the process.\r\n- New `platform` namespace with abstractions for platform specific operations or getting information about platforms and tools. This includes dynamic loading of shared objects and file and directory operations.\r\n- start ongoing project to change how errors and warnings are reported and documented \r\n- Improved portability, especially to Windows. It is now possible to build most of LAMMPS (including unit testing) natively on Windows with Visual Studio 2022 and MSVC++ compilers or Clang or Intel OneAPI compilers. Settings for Visual Studio are included.\r\n- Improved plugin mechanism and option to automatically load custom plugins that are either not distributed with LAMMPS or depend on libraries that have licensing terms or technical requirements preventing linking them into LAMMPS directly. Examples for how to build such plugins for the KIM and the ML-PACE package are included. For the latter also a NSIS script to build an installer for Windows.\r\n- Semi-automatic refactoring with clang-tidy: this has updated the coding style to take advantage of C++11 features and make things more explicit, so the compiler can warn more easily about problems. Also, clang-format is now applied to more files.\r\n- update force style unit tests to work with Kokkos + OpenMP\r\n- Refactor handling of thermodynamic output for better readability and add new thermo_style \"yaml\"\r\n- Automatically load plugins in folders listed in the LAMMPS_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable\r\n- More content and improvements for the Programmer Guide section of the Manual\r\n\r\n## Updates and new commands or styles or packages: \r\n- New fix acks2/reaxff for ACKS2 charge equilibration and updates to fix qeq/reaxff that add support for fix efield to both charge equilibration methods.\r\n- New fix mol/swap for swapping of atom types within a single, randomly selected molecule\r\n- Add support for multi-species potentials to ML-PACE package\r\n- Allow GPU package pair styles to be used with `newton_pair on`\r\n- New pair style sw/mod providing an empirically modified Stillinger-Weber potential suitable for compounds like MoS2\r\n- New pair style nm/cut/split and bond style fene/nm for coarse grain polymer models\r\n- Support for binary native dump files for read_dump and rerun\r\n- Updated singularity/apptainer definition files\r\n- New compute ave/sphere/atom to compute averaged properties in a sphere around atoms\r\n- Support writing to dump files at regular time interface for variable timestep simulations\r\n- Add centroid atomic stress support for shake, rattle and rigid/small fixes\r\n- Add new pair style harmonic/cut providing a repulsive-only harmonic potential\r\n- Add new fix numdiff/virial for deriving virial stress from potential energy via numerical differences\r\n- Add two new interlayer pair styles ilp/tmd and saip/metal \r\n- new option for multi-file dumps to have files that are more evenly sized to address post-processing and visualization issues for simulations of very large systems \r\n- accelerator support (including KOKKOS) and improvements for dynamical_matrix and third_order commands\r\n- re-implementation of the tools/eam_database Fortran code in Python\r\n- update setup.py and install.py for python module to use setuptools instead of deprecated distutils and build a binary wheel file\r\n- Add computes for local components of the pressure tensor in cartesian and spherical coordinates\r\n- Major update of the LATBOLTZ package\r\n- Code optimization for several KOKKOS styles\r\n- Add fixes for damping of rotational and translational energy for extended particles\r\n- Add support for an inner cutoff switching function to SNAP related commands that smoothly turns of SNAP descriptors at short range\r\n- Memory usage optimization and bugfix for mesocnt pair style\r\n- new BPM package for bonded particle models \r\n- new ELECTRODE package\r\n- updates and additions to the DIELECTRIC package \r\n- new compute fep/ta for the FEP package implementing test-area perturbation\r\n- new pair styles ilp/graphene/hbn/opt, ilp/tmd/opt, and saip/metal/opt for the OPT package with 2x speedup \r\n- new pair styles smatb and smatb/single for the SMTBQ package\r\n- new dump_style yaml command in the EXTRA-DUMP package\r\n- add Kspace support to the PLUGIN package\r\n- enhancements and additions for the MDI package. This obsoletes the MESSAGE package.\r\n- additions to the BROWNIAN package to support different rotational and translational temperatures and option to constrain rotation in a plane in 3d\r\n- additions to PyTorch support in ML-IAP packge\r\n- new compute born/matrix command to compute elastic stress\r\n- add KOKKOS package versions of the pair styles from the DPD-BASIC package\r\n- add KOKKOS package version of pair style adp\r\n- new colname option for dump_modify and thermo_modify to replace the column header strings for thermo output or in dump files\r\n- add support for writing yaml format files to fix ave/time and also support fix_modify colname similar to thermo and dump\r\n- add support for angle styles to fix adapt and add or update \"extract()\" methods to some angle/bond styles and make the extract arguments more consistent \r\n- add region style ellipsoid\r\n- add \"aveabs\" and \"sumabs\" options to compute reduce\r\n- add \"variable\" option to delete_atoms command\r\n- bugfix for DOF handling in compute temp/profile\r\n- more consistent behavior of dynamic groups through moving the invocation of the internal fix to a later time in the timestep \r\n- make time thermo property restartable and implement a reset_timestep time option to set it manually\r\n- remove support for legacy GPU hardware and CUDA toolkits in the GPU package\r\n- Update of the bundled Kokkos library to version 3.6.0\r\n- Update of the bundled Colvars library to version 2022-05-24 \r\n- Add KOKKOS package version of the pace pair style from the ML-PACE package\r\n- New pair styles \"sw/angle/table\" and \"threebody/table\" for the MANYBODY package \r\n- Add support for GPU accelerated FFTs with HIP and KOKKOS\r\n- Add support for SO3 descriptors to the ML-IAP package\r\n- New \"overlap\" option for `create_atoms random` that will avoid close contacts\r\n- New \"mesh\" option for create_atoms to approximate meshes from STL files with atoms\r\n- Add timer style variables for measuring wall time in seconds from the input script \r\n\r\n## Backward compatibility notices:\r\n- `delete_atoms porosity` has been renamed to `delete_atoms random` and uses/supports different options\r\n- The CC.Lebedeva interlayer potential file has been updated. It now uses by default parameters for \"normal\" conditions. The previous default parameters are tuned for high-pressure conditions and are still available when using \"C1\" instead of \"C\" as element.\r\n- Using the PyLammps python module now requires the presence of numpy\r\n- The new version of make install-python will not install a package over an existing package as the old version did. Instead, it will attempt to uninstall the old package and then install the new version. Packages installed with distutils, like the old version of make install-python, must be manually uninstalled (they don't store a suitable manifest). This should only be needed once, since from then on uninstall should be possible.\r\n- The update to the LATBOLTZ package is a significant update that changes the syntax of the fix lb/fluid command in a way that is not backward compatible. Inputs must be updated accordingly. Also fixes lb/pc and lb/pc/rigid/sphere have been removed and fixes nve and rigid should be used in their stead.\r\n- The thermodynamic output format is slightly changed. This may break parser implementations for analysis of LAMMPS log files that are not indifferent to whitespace changes and width of fields.\r\n- the MESSAGE package has been removed. its functionality is provided in a more general way by the MDI package\r\n- the GPU package using CUDA now requires CUDA toolkit version 8 or later and GPU architector 3.0 (aka Kepler or later). When compiling for OpenCL, driver support for OpenCL 1.2 is required. OpenCL can provide support for GPUs not supported by the CUDA toolkit anymore.\r\n- the bug fix to the DOF calculation in compute temp/profile changes the results (usually by a small margin)",
