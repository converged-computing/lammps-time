The 2 June 2020 version should **not** be used anymore and replaced with this version.\r\n\r\nChanges since the patch release 2 June 2020:\r\n- Bugfixes for read_data and read_restart that were introduced during the recent refactoring of the AtomVec class. Additional bugfixes for case of using many fixes that store per-atom data, broken KIM package compilation, and a few minor issues. updates for some singularity definition files. (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2132\r\n- New package USER-MESONT that adds the `tubular potential model` (TPM). This consist of a Fortran library, a pair_style and compute, and tools for generating force field files. Pair style `mesocnt`, which implements the same model in C++-only has been moved from USER-MISC to this package (Maxim V. Shugaev & Leonid V. Zhigilei, University of Virginia, Alexey N. Volkov, University of Alabama) PR #1873 \r\n- New fix orient/eco to add an \"energy conserving orientation\" force, which is a superset of what fix orient/fcc and fix orient/bcc do. (Adrian Schratt and Volker Mohles, Ruhr-Uni Bochum)) PR #2126 \r\n- Update to Nose-Hoover barostats to allow setting a barostat temperature if there is no temperature compute already included (Joel Clemmer, Ishan Srivastava, SNL) PR #2137\r\n- Document access to contact information for fix wall/gran and fix wall/gran/region and fix some issue with not deleting \"expired\" contacts (Richard Berger, Temple U) PR #2121 \r\n- Remove extra large (potential) files from the distribution and instead download them on demand from downloads.lammps.org when the corresponding package is installed/configured. Apply to pair style mesocnt as first case (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2139\r\n- Add a \"UNITS:\" metadata tag to (most) potential files in the potentials folder and code to file readers to check for these tags and report and error if there is a mismatch. Table files generated by `pair_write` and `bond_write` will add these as the first line when a file is newly created and all subsequent attempts to append a table will check for consistent units or  error out (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) #2159\r\n- Add a sort option to the `reset_ids` command to obtain consistent atom ids in parallel regardless of the number of MPI ranks (Steve Plimpton, SNL) PR #2142\r\n- Continued refactoring of string handling and output formatting by increasing the use of {fmt} and std::string, (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2127, PR #2128, PR #2148\r\n- Continued refactoring and optimization of file readers to increase code reuse and become thread safe (Richard Berger, Temple U) PR #2122, PR #2144\r\n- Consolidate `union ubuf` definitions in lmptype.h header file instead of individual classes (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2151\r\n- More tests and unittest updates (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2123\r\n- Add clang-format support to the C++ sources in the unittest tree (Richard Berger and Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #2157\r\n- Utilities to check and correct files in the distribution for whitespace and permission issues (Richard Berger, Temple U) PR #2154\r\n- Various small updates and corrections (various authors) PR #2121, PR #2124, PR #2129, PR #2133, PR #2135, PR #2140, PR #2141, PR #2143, PR #2147, PR #2149, PR #2152, PR #2155, PR #2156, PR #2160, PR #2161\r\n\r\nBackward compatibility notices:\r\n- People that want to use the `mesocnt` pair style now need to install the USER-MESONT package instead of USER-MISC\r\n- The potential file C_10_10.mesocnt has been removed from the distribution due to its size. It will be downloaded automatically when the USER-MESONT package is installed for the first time."

(Steve Plimpton, Stan Moore, SNL) PR #1788 , PR #2080, PR #2092\r\n- Add new thread-safe and simpler to use tokenizer and word counter classes. Apply to file readers for manybody potentials and several other places. Richard Berger (Temple U) PR #2113 \r\n- Integrate {fmt} to generate printf() style formatted C++ strings and thus make generating those less complex and safer. Also add `utils::logmesg()` convenience function to send string to both, screen and logfile, with one call.  Axel Kohlmeyer (Temple U), PR #2103\r\n- Add the first step of a comprehensive integrated unittest library with support for testing a selection of pair, bond, and angle styles under various conditions and with multiple uses. (Axel Kohlmeyer and Richard Berger, Temple U) PR #2098 , PR #2100, PR #2101, PR #2108 , PR #2114, PR #2119\r\n- Add support for molecule fragments to fix bond/react (Jake Gissinger, CU Bolder), PR #2106 \r\n- Partial cleanup of makefiles for conventional build (Mike Brown, Intel Corp), PR #2071 \r\n- Update of Kokkos library to version 3.1.1 (Christoph Junghans, LANL and the Kokkos developers) PR #2070 \r\n- Update default version of LATTE to 1.2.2 (Christoph Junghans, LANL) PR #2069 \r\n- More tweaks and updates to CMake scripts (Christoph Junghans, LANL), PR #2068, PR #2069 \r\n- Various small updates and corrections (various authors) PR #2074, PR #2077, PR #2080, PR #2082, PR #2091, PR #2093, PR #2094, PR #2095, PR #2105, PR #2110, PR #2111, PR #2116, PR #2118\r\n\r\nBackward compatibility notices:\r\n- The refactoring of the AtomVec classes could possibly break any external packages that provide their own AtomVec classes or contain styles that depend on the name of per-atom properties that were renamed. All AtomVec derived classes bundled within LAMMPS have been updated.\r\n- The refactored reading and parsing of potential files will now be reporting an error on Fortran-style double precision floating-point numbers with a \"d\" exponent instead of silently ignoring the \"d\" and the exponent. Potential files bundled with LAMMPS have been corrected (their exponent was \"d0\", so it does - by chance - not affect any results).\r\n- The (unsupported) previous library of simple run tests for LAMMPS has been replaced by a more systematic and comprehensive unit test library which will be significantly expanded over time.

Always build a library and link the executable to the library. That reduces the choices to \"static\" and \"shared\" with \"static\" as default (like before). Add tutorials for creating stack traces with gdb or valgrind and for using CMake (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #1981\r\n- improved error messages and related documentation for USER-MEAMC (Sebastian Huetter, OvGuericke U) PR #1965\r\n- extensions to fix restrain to allow for a growing or shrinking bond restraint, and a new lower bound only bond restraint with the same option (David Castillo and Marco Di Stefano, Structural Genomics Group, CNAG-CRG) PR #1957 \r\n- new `kim_property` command in the KIM package (Yaser Afshar, Ellad Tadmor, Daniel S. Karls, Ryan Elliott , UMN) PR #1946 \r\n- internal KIM command for matching symbolic to numeric atom types (Ron Miller, Carleton U and\r\nRyan S. Elliott, UMN) PR #1999\r\n- use preprocessor macros to enable compatibility of OpenMP directives with otherwise incompatible OpenMP 3.x and OpenMP 4.x and later const variable sharing semantics (Michael Lamparski) PR #1651\r\n- new functions in Info class and library interface to query installed styles (Richard Berger, Temple U) PR #1966\r\n- added extract methods to several bond styles for use with fix adapt (Evangelos Voyiatzis, NovaMechanics Ltd) PR #1973\r\n- refactored and generalized the way how LAMMPS detects how multiple fixes change box data and whether there are conflicts. (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U) PR #1874 \r\n- core-shell version of pair style lj/class2/coul/long (Evangelos Voyiatzis, NovaMechanics Ltd) PR #1978\r\n- added support for apply scale in fix adapt to diameter and charge, diameter/disc option for mass changes consistent with 2d systems (Jibril B. Coulibaly, Northwestern U) PR #1937 \r\n- updated and additional singularity container definition files for developing/debugging LAMMPS (Richard Berger, Temple U) PR #1975\r\n- small fixes and updates to code and documentation (multiple authors) PR #1952, PR #1962, PR #1979 , PR #1988, PR #1992, PR #1993, PR #1998, PR #1889, PR #1997, PR #1994 \r\n\r\nBackward compatibility notice:\r\n- Kokkos 3.0 changes some of its internal CMake variables and how it is configured via CMake. This is handled transparently with the conventional make build, but requires changes for CMake builds and is not compatible with existing build folders.\r\n- Custom makefiles for the conventional build need to be changed. All bundled makefiles have been updated. The changes are in the section that is not supposed to be customized, so updates should be straightforward.\r\n- In the conventional make build procedure there are now only two build modes `mode=static` (the default) and `mode=shared`. The previous choices are still available and mapped to one of them (i.e. `mode=exe` and `mode=lib` will set `mode=static`, and `mode=shexe` and `mode=shlib` will set `mode=shared`)."

    "body": "**IMPORTANT NOTE**:\r\nThis is the last LAMMPS release that does NOT require a C++11 compiler for the core code and CMake version 3.10 or newer. The next patches and stable releases will require a C++11 compatible C++ compiler to compile all of LAMMPS, not just for some of the optional packages. For some older compilers (e.g. GCC 4.8.x on CentOS 7.x) a flag to enable C++11 support may be required (e.g. `-std=c++11` or `-std=gnu++11`  in the case of GCC 4.8.x).\r\n\r\n### Below is a list of major changes since the last stable release 7 August 2019.\r\n\r\n## General changes\r\n* The documentation file format has been changed from the custom txt2html markup to using reStructuredText (rst). This provides several advantages to have a better looking and more functional documentation. As a first step, all externally rendered equations have been converted to embedded math and all raw HTML markup converted. Most boxes with examples, will use syntax highlighting. Further improvements of typesetting and layout are forthcoming. Additional consistency checks are now applied when processing the documentation.\r\n* Many file read operations are now monitored for read errors and thus allowing to detect damaged or incomplete files like potential parameter files and restart files\r\n* Updates and improvements to the CMake build system to more closely match all the functionality provided by the conventional make based build system\r\n* Support for threaded FFTs from FFTW and MKL, support for cuFFT and KISSFFT on the GPU with KOKKOS\r\n* Expose neighbor lists to the library interface and the Python wrapper\r\n* Documentation of installing LAMMPS via `conda`\r\n* Many small improvements or bugfixes\r\n\r\n## Updates and new commands or styles\r\n- new `dump_modify` options to embed `ITEM: UNITS` and `ITEM: TIME` with information about units and accumulated simulation time\r\n- new pair styles `cosine/squared`, `local/density`, `mesocnt`\r\n- new fix styles `wall/reflect/stochastic`, `propel/self`, 'npt/cauchy`\r\n- new compute `gyration/shape/chunk`\r\n- new compute `hma` for fast, high-precision computation of certain thermodynamic properties of solids\r\n- new compute style `centroid/stress/atom` for computing per atom stress in a way allowing for more accurate heat flux computations with interactions involving more than two atoms\r\n- new `third_order` command, a companion command to `dynamical_matrix`, for computing the third order force tensor from finite differences\r\n- new options `ratio` and `subset` for `create_atoms` and similarly new options `type/ratio` and `type/subset` to the `set` command\r\n- new tool for post-processing parallel tempering trajectories\r\n- multiple updates, bugfixes, and improvements to `fix bond/react`\r\n- improved implementation of minimization style `fire`\r\n- support to run NWChem along with LAMMPS in client/server mode\r\n\r\n## Updates for packages\r\n- KOKKOS now supports minimization (limited to minimization styles `cg` and `quadratic`), updates to the KOKKOS library, general improvements and bugfixes, more styles ported to KOKKOS\r\n- several new SNAP potentials\r\n- tweaks to USER-INTEL to compile correctly with too aggressively optimizing compilers, corrections and improvements\r\n- bugfixes and improvements for the GRANULAR package\r\n- several new SNAP potentials and a new compute `snap` for training SNAP potentials\r\n- bugfixes and improvements to the KIM package, new command `kim_param` for accessing KIM model parameters\r\n- updates to the USER-COLVARS package with updates to the included Lepton library\r\n- updates to the USER-PLUMED package with bugfixes and support for recent releases\r\n- updates to the USER-CGDNA package including a new coarse grained RNA model (oxRNA2)\r\n- improvements and updates to the SPIN package, L-BFGS minimizer added\r\n- updates, extensions, and improvements to the USER-MEAMC package\r\n- memory leaks fixed when using styles from the GPU with multiple run commands, new pair style `lj/cut/tip4p/long/gpu`\r\n- updates to `fix rigid` variants to add gravity to rigid objects with overlapping (granular) particles\r\n- support for `rerun` and `read_dump` with USER-ADIOS\r\n\r\n## Backward compatibility notices\r\n- building the USER-COLVARS package with all features enabled now requires a C++-11 compatible compiler\r\n- due to changes in the random number generator initialization, results when using `fix pour`, `fix deposit`, `fix evaporate` or `create_atoms random` will not match with previous versions of LAMMPS. see PR #1569 \r\n- the `gjf` keyword for `fix langevin` no longer supports the option `yes`. Instead you have to use either `vhalf` or `vfull`\r\n- the FIRE minimizer has been replaced with an improved implementation. The previous implementation is available as `fire/old`.\r\n- new documentation has to be written in reStructuredText format\r\n"

(Aleksei Ivanov, U of Iceland, Julien Tranchida, SNL), PR #1598 \r\n- bugfix for pppm/tip4p when using non-orthogonal simulation cells, PR #1719 \r\n- bugfix for restarting SPIN package runs and documentation clarification (Julien Tranchida, SNL), PR #1692 \r\n- multiple bugfixes and documentation corrections for pair style `granular` (Jibril B. Coulibaly, Northwestern U), PR #1631 \r\n- avoid correlations between multiple runs with random seeds incremented by 1 when using random placement of atoms (Jun-Chieh Wang (Applied Materials), PR #1569\r\n- fix a memory leak in the GPU package when doing multiple `run` commands in the same input, (Trung Nguyen, Northwestern U), PR #1735\r\n- Optimizations for using SNAP with KOKKOS (Stan Moore, SNL and Rahul Gayatri, NERSC), PR #1693\r\n- new examples folder \"UNITS\" with examples highlighting how to run inputs for the same system with different unit sets and convert output between different them (Steve Plimpton, SNL), PR #1709 \r\n- capture return value of calls to fread by using a wrapper, `utils::sfread()` and thus enable error reporting on reading restarts, (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U/ICTP) PR #1731\r\n- A couple of singularity definition files to build container images for compiling/testing/debugging LAMMPS on different Linux variants, PR #1726, PR #1738\r\n- various small changes, updates, and bugfixes (multiple authors), PR #1701, PR #1699, PR #1716, PR #1714, PR #1727, PR #1728, PR #1733, PR #1732, PR #1746, PR #1750, PR #1744, PR #1751\r\n\r\nBackward compatibility notice:\r\n- The `gjf` keyword for the `fix langevin` no longer supports `yes` as an option. Instead you have to use either `vhalf` or `vfull`.\r\n- due to changes in the random number generator initializations, results when using `fix pour`, `fix deposit` or `fix evaporate` and when using `create_atoms random` will not match with previous versions of LAMMPS. see PR #1569\r\n- Building the Colvars library with all features included now requires a C++11 compiler (see http://colvars.github.io/README-c++11.html).\r\n"

Bolintineanu, Ishan Srivastava, Jeremy B. Lechman, SNL)\r\n- new pair style drip for dihedral-angle-corrected registry-dependent interlayer potential (DRIP) (Mingjian Wen, U Minnesota)\r\n- new pair style e3b for adding option to model the E3B water potential (Steven E. Strong, U Chicago)\r\n- new fix style electron/stopping for modeling energy loss through interactions high speed atoms with electrons (K. Avchaciov (Tartu U and U Helsinki) Risto Toijala (University of Helsinki) and others)\r\n- update to USER-COLVARS package to version 2019-04-26\r\n- update of the KIM package to use KIM-API v2.0 (Ryan Elliot, UMN)\r\n- update to USER-INTEL package to enable use of the package with -DLAMMPS_BIGBIG and some other small updates and corrections: (W. Michael Brown, Intel Corp.)\r\n- update to USER-PTM package. examples added, license info updated, documentation updates (Peter Larsen, MIT)\r\n- updates and additions to the SPIN package (Julien Tranchida, SNL)\r\n- updates to hyper-dynamics support (Steve Plimpton, SNL)\r\n- updates, improvements, and bugfixes to fix bond/react (Jake Gissinger, U Colorado)\r\n- bugfix/refactoring of REBO pair style to correctly implement what is advertised in the documentation. Added consistency check on potential files for AIREBO, REBO, AIREBO-M (Cyril Falvo Université Paris Sud)\r\n\r\nIn addition there are many small bug fixes, corrections for memory leaks, and memory management inconsistencies and general improvements.\r\n\r\nBackward compatibility notices:\r\n- as announced with the last stable release, the packages REAX and MEAM are no longer included.\r\n- fixes `atom/swap`, `deposit`, and `gcmc` had incompatible changes to the restart handling, so those fixes cannot be restarted from restart files written by older versions of LAMMPS. If those fixes are not included or not restarted, restart files should remain backward compatible.\r\n- the syntax for pair style kim is changed with the update to KIM-API v2.0\r\n- the syntax of the pair_style snap command has changed by removing a redundant element specifier\r\n- pair style `rebo` no longer is compatible with the `CH.airebo` potential file, but now requires its own potential file `CH.rebo`. Tests are added to all AIREBO derived pair styles, that only compatible potential files are read in.\r\n- the moltemplate package is no longer bundled with LAMMPS. it can be installed with pip or downloaded from www.moltemplate.org\r\n"

PR #1464 (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U)\r\n- Do not enable OpenMP (i.e. `BUILD_OMP`) by default with gcc 9.x due to incompatibilities in the OpenMP directive semantics. PR #1483 (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U)\r\n- Updates for restart file processing of fixes `atom/swap`, `deposit`, and `gcmc`. Now it is checked that the time step was not reset and the number of total MC attempts and successful MC attempts are restarted, too. PR #1484 (Axel Kohlmeyer, Temple U)\r\n- Properly and cleanly support pair style hybrid and hybrid/overlay for `pair_style quip`. PR #1479 (Axel Kohlmeyer)\r\n- Make sure that format style variables (and format suffixes in immediate variables) only use valid conversions.

The offending code has been removed in #1321, which also contains several minor cleanups and bugfixes.\r\n\r\nBeyond this important bugfix the patch includes an update of the Kokkos library to version 2.8.00 ( #1312 ),\r\na new KOKKOS angle style `cosine` (#1306), and a rename of the python package base source files to avoid conflicts on OSs with case insensitive file systems (e.g. MacOS and Windows) #1316 \r\n\r\nAlso included are updates to the appearance and management of processing pull requests and issues on GitHub (#1318 , #1319, #1322)"
