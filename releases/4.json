    "body": "Here are a list of the major changes since the last stable release 22 August 2018:\r\n\r\ngeneral:\r\n- major improvements to building LAMMPS with CMake. Almost all functionality of the conventional build is available and some build features now exist only with CMake builds\r\n- significant consolidation and improved consistency of the manual after the refactoring for the last stable release, option to build a .mobi version (for Kindle readers) of the manual from .epub files (many other e-book readers but not Kindle). The manual checks out clean when running `make spelling` in the doc folder. from now on, all new contributions to LAMMPS will be automatically spellchecked before inclusion.\r\n- reduced risk of memory/buffer overflows by replacing most uses of `sprintf()` by `snprintf()`\r\n\r\nnew packages:\r\n- USER-PLUMED package with a native interface (no more patching) for more options to do free energy calculations beyond existing features in LAMMPS. Similar to the colvars library of USER-COLVARS, the Plumed2 library interfaced by USER-PLUMED is supported by multiple MD codes.\r\n- USER-SDPD package for smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD)\r\n- USER-PTM package for polyhedral template matching analysis to characterize local structure\r\n- new kspace style scafacos, which interfaces to the ScaFaCoS library of long-range coulomb solvers.\r\n\r\nupdates for packages:\r\n- USER-COLVARS: updates and bugfixes\r\n- REPLICA: added support for (local and global) hyperdynamics\r\n- KOKKOS: updated Kokkos library, added several KOKKOS versions of styles from the GRANULAR package, support for data duplication when using threading (more efficient with few threads)/\r\n- USER-INTEL: updates, bugfixes and improved support for using \r\n- USER-MISC: new styles, compute pressure/cylinder, fix ffl (fast forward langevin), bugfixes and improvements to fix bond/react, compute stress/mop and compute stress/mop/profile using the method of planes, Axilrod-Teller-Muto potential (pair_style atm)\r\n\r\nMany small bugfixes, corrections for memory leaks and memory management inconsistencies and general improvements.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE: this is going to be the last LAMMPS version containing the REAX and MEAM packages. They have been essentially unmaintained and thus deprecated for a long time and are superseded by the USER-REAXC (with accelerator support in KOKKOS and USER-OMP) and the USER-MEAMC package.\r\n\r\nBackward compatibility notices:\r\n- the command line flags -restart and -r are no longer available. They have been replaced by -restart2data and -r2data, respectively.\r\n- the naming conventions for the group name of groups maintained by fix bond/react have changed. Documentation and examples have been updated accordingly.\r\n- pair styles in the USER-SPH package no longer support Pair::single(). The existing functions reported always energy and forces 0, and thus have been removed.\r\n- the meaning of the sign of mu in fix atom/swap has been reversed to be consistent with usual conventions. Thus behavior is changed significantly. The old, incorrect behavior can be recovered by reversing the sign of mu.\r\n- the default installation prefix for CMake based compilation has been changed from /usr/local to $HOME/.local, so that people can safely do make install with default settings and without root access or sudo."
